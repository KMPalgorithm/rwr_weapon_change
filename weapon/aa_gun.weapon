	<!-- Scoring for target priority. Distance is between 0 and 1 based on range; direction is between 0 and 1 based on whether its near the barrel; squad_command is between 0 and on based on how close to the player's command order is, and base_score is a weight.. -->
	<!-- These all add together and the highest 'score' is the new target, targets are rescanned every 2.5 seconds to see if a new higher-score target is in sight-range. -->
	<!-- You must define a blank tag at the top of the list to handle all cases where the vehicle is fighting something "undefined", which is what common infantry might best fit under. -->
